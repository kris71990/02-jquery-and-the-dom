## Lab 2 - jQuery and the DOM

**Author**: Kris Sakarias
**Author**: Jose Flores
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This is a blog that displays articles in the order from top down in which they were published. Articles are constructed and then appended to the DOM with jQuery.

## Getting Started
Create a constructor and set its variables equal to properties of the article objects. Target the article template in the html and append the correctly rendered articles to the DOM with jQuery.

## Architecture
This is accomplished with jQuery by finding the proper elements and filling in their text with the values of the appropriate properties of the object.

## Change Log
9:30 - connected css, included jQuery, and changed for loops to forEach; completed some other easy to-dos and comments
10:00 - create constructor and initialize values
10:30 - target elements in dom and append the value of the appropriate property in the correct place in the template
11:30 - struggle trying to figure out why data is not showing on the blog; this is because all articles have class template and my css was set to display template class elements to none. Easy fix, hard to find what was going wrong.
12:30 - once this was solved, smooth sailing and finishing the readme.
